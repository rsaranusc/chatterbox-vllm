# Chatterbox TTS on vLLM

This is a port of https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox to vLLM. Why?

* Improved performance and more efficient use of GPU memory.
  * Early benchmarks show ~4x speedup in generation tokens/s without batching, and over 10x with batching. This is a significant improvement over the original Chatterbox implementation, which was bottlenecked by unnecessary CPU-GPU sync/transfers within the HF transformers implementation.
  * More rigorous benchmarking is WIP, but will likely come after batching is fully fleshed out.
* Easier integration with state-of-the-art inference infrastructure.

# Project Status: Usable and with Benchmark-Topping Throughput

* ✅ Basic speech cloning with audio and text conditioning.
* ✅ Outputs match the quality of the original Chatterbox implementation.
* ✅ Context Free Guidance (CFG) is implemented.
  * Due to a vLLM limitation, CFG can not be tuned on a per-request basis and can only be configured via the `CHATTERBOX_CFG_SCALE` environment variable.
* ✅ Exaggeration control is implemented.
* ✅ vLLM batching is implemented and produces a significant speedup.
* ℹ️ Project uses vLLM internal APIs and extremely hacky workarounds to get things done.
  * Refactoring to the idiomatic vLLM way of doing things is WIP, but will require some changes to vLLM.
  * Until then, this is a Rube Goldberg machine that will likely only work with vLLM 0.9.2.
  * Follow https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/21989 for updates.
* ℹ️ Substantial refactoring is needed to further clean up unnecessary workarounds and code paths.
* ℹ️ Server API is not implemented and will likely be out-of-scope for this project.
* ❌ Learned speech positional embeddings are not applied, pending support in vLLM. However, this doesn't seem to be causing a very noticeable degradation in quality.
* ❌ APIs are not yet stable and may change.
* ❌ Benchmarks and performance optimizations are not yet implemented.

# Installation

This project only supports Linux and WSL2 with Nvidia hardware. AMD _may_ work with minor tweaks, but is not tested.

Prerequisites: `git` and [`uv`](https://pypi.org/project/uv/) must be installed

```
git clone https://github.com/randombk/chatterbox-vllm.git
cd chatterbox-vllm
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

The package should automatically download the correct model weights from the Hugging Face Hub.

If you encounter CUDA issues, try resetting the venv and using `uv pip install -e .` instead of `uv sync`.


# Updating

If you are updating from a previous version, run `uv sync` to update the dependencies. The package will automatically download the correct model weights from the Hugging Face Hub.

# Example

[This example](https://github.com/randombk/chatterbox-vllm/blob/master/example-tts.py) can be run with `python example-tts.py` to generate audio samples for three different prompts using three different voices.

```python
import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox_vllm.tts import ChatterboxTTS


if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained(
        gpu_memory_utilization = 0.4,
        max_model_len = 1000,

        # Disable CUDA graphs to reduce startup time for one-off generation.
        enforce_eager = True,
    )

    for i, audio_prompt_path in enumerate([None, "docs/audio-sample-01.mp3", "docs/audio-sample-03.mp3"]):
        prompts = [
            "You are listening to a demo of the Chatterbox TTS model running on VLLM.",
            "This is a separate prompt to test the batching implementation.",
            "And here is a third prompt. It's a bit longer than the first one, but not by much.",
        ]
    
        audios = model.generate(prompts, audio_prompt_path=audio_prompt_path, exaggeration=0.8)
        for audio_idx, audio in enumerate(audios):
            ta.save(f"test-{i}-{audio_idx}.mp3", audio, model.sr)
```

# Multilingual

An early version of Multilingual support is available (see [this example](https://github.com/randombk/chatterbox-vllm/blob/master/example-tts-multilingual.py)). However there *are* quality degradations compared to the original model, driven by:
* Alignment Stream Analyzer is not implemented, which can result in errors, repetitions, and extra noise at the end of the audio snippet.
* The lack of learned speech positional encodings is also much more noticible.
* Russian text stress is not yet implemented.

For the list of supported languages, see [here](https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-languages).

# Benchmarks

To run a benchmark, tweak and run `benchmark.py`.
The following results were obtained with batching on a 6.6k-word input (`docs/benchmark-text-1.txt`), generating ~40min of audio.

Notes:
 * I'm not _entirely_ sure what the tokens/s figures from vLLM are showing - the figures probably aren't directly comparable to others, but the results speak for themselves.
 * With vLLM, **the T3 model is no longer the bottleneck**
   * Vast majority of time is now spent on the S3Gen model, which is not ported/portable to vLLM. This currently uses the original reference implementation from the Chatterbox repo, so there's potential for integrating some of the other community optimizations here.
   * This also means the vLLM section of the model never fully ramps to its peak throughput in these benchmarks.
 * Benchmarks are done without CUDA graphs, as that is currently causing correctness issues.
 * There are some issues with my very rudimentary chunking logic, which is causing some occasional artifacts in output quality.

# Chatterbox Architecture

I could not find an official explanation of the Chatterbox architecture, so below is my best explanation based on the codebase. Chatterbox broadly follows the [CosyVoice](https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice2/) architecture, applying intermediate fusion multimodal conditioning to a 0.5B parameter Llama model.

# Implementation Notes

## CFG Implementation Details

vLLM does not support CFG natively, so substantial hacks were needed to make it work. At a high level, we trick vLLM into thinking the model has double the hidden dimension size as it actually does, then splitting and restacking the states to invoke Llama with double the original batch size. This does pose a risk that vLLM will underestimate the memory requirements of the model - more research is needed into whether vLLM's initial profiling pass will capture this nuance.

# Changelog

## `0.2.1`
* Updated to multilingual v2

## `0.2.0`
* Initial multilingual support.

## `0.1.5`
* Fix Python packaging missing the tokenizer.json file

## `0.1.4`
* Change default step count back to 10 due to feedback about quality degradation.
* Fixed a bug in the `gradio_tts_app.py` implementation (#13).
* Fixed a bug with how symlinks don't work if the module is installed normally (vs as a dev environment) (#12).
  * The whole structure of how this project should be integrated into downstream repos is something that needs rethinking.

## `0.1.3`
* Added ability to tweak S3Gen diffusion steps, and default it to 5 (originally 10). This improves performance with nearly indistinguishable quality loss.

## `0.1.2`
* Update to `vllm 0.10.0`
* Fixed error where batched requests sometimes get truncated, or otherwise jumbled.
  * This also removes the need to double-apply batching when submitting requests. You can submit as many prompts as you'd like into the `generate` function, and `vllm` should perform the batching internally without issue. See changes to `benchmark.py` for details.
  * There is still a (very rare, theoretical) possibility that this issue can still happen. If it does, submit a ticket with repro steps, and tweak your max batch size or max token count as a workaround.


## `0.1.1`
* Misc minor cleanups
* API changes:
  * Use `max_batch_size` instead of `gpu_memory_utilization`
  * Use `compile=False` (default) instead of `enforce_eager=True`
  * Look at the latest examples to follow API changes. As a reminder, I do not expect the API to become stable until `1.0.0`.

## `0.1.0`
* Initial publication to pypi
* Moved audio conditioning processing out of vLLM to avoid re-computing it for every request.

## `0.0.1`
* Initial release
